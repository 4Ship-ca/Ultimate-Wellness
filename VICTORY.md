## 🐛 **One Tiny Polish Fix:**

There was one minor error that didn't stop the app from working:

### Error #33: `EXERCISES is not defined`
**Location:** app.js:1531 (updateExerciseGrid)  
**Impact:** Minor - only affects exercise grid  
**Fix:** ✅ Added EXERCISES constant with common exercises

```javascript
const EXERCISES = [
    'Walking',
    'Running',
    'Cycling',
    'Swimming',
    'Yoga',
    'Strength Training',
    'Dancing',
    'Sports',
    'Other'
];
```
